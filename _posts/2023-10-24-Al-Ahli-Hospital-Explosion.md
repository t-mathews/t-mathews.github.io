On the evening of October 17th, 2023, reports emerged of a large blast at the Al-Ahli (Al-Ma'amadani) Hospital in Gaza City.

Gaza's Ministry of Health immediately declared over 500 deaths and many more wounded, with the claim that the IAF had conducted an airstrike on the location.

Israel Defence Force's Initial IDF Aftermath Report was released with the claim that "the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) fired a barrage of ten rockets at Israel from a cemetery near the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza. This triggered rocket sirens as far north as Ramat Gan, Bat Yam and Beni Brak."

From initial comparisons of the crater left after the explosion, with other sites of rockets attacks (see below), the nature of the crater is extremely similar, which indicates that the likelihood of the explosion being caused by a rocket is very likely.

The lack of blunt edges on the crater, as well as the relatively small radius of the crater, of which conventional bombs used by the IAF have much larger, flatter craters also indicate that this is the crater of some form of rocket, presumably failing midflight and landing near the hospital.
